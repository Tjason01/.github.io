    <p><em><strong>Our Story...</strong></em> A family owned business that started from scratch,
       hoping to make it only to find out that they would be swamped with so many customers that the line would go onto the street and around the corner.
      It would be hard sometimes having to deal with the long lines, especially in the heat and with such a small cart.
      The customers would only see us on Sunday’s since that’s when we’d be on the other side of the street of the church and everyone would come to us.
      But, it was harder on us when it came to the winter time and we couldn’t sell, money was low during those times. That’s when we came up with the idea
      of opening a shop. After two years of selling off of our cart we made enough money to buy the vacant building off the same street where we would sell.
<br>Opening the ice cream shop was perfect for us. We made a wider range of food rather than just ice cream. Our customers don’t have to worry about the wait
 and heat. And not worry about only seeing us on Sunday’s and come in any day. We also still have business open during the winter and our customers can enjoy
  our warm elotes or a nice cofe for the weather.
