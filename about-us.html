    <p><em><strong>Our Story...</strong></em> A family owned business that started from scratch,
      hoping to make it in America only to find out that they would be swamped with so many customers,
      the lines would go onto the street and around the corner.
      It would be difficult sometimes having to deal with the long lines, especially in the heat and with such a small cart.
      The customers would only see us on Sunday’s since that’s when we’d be on the other side of the street of the church and everyone would come to us.
      But, it was harder on us when it came to the winter time and couldn’t sell anythin, money was low during those times. Having to deal with that ifhgt for survival we dicided to open up a shop.
      After two years of selling from our cart we made enough money to buy the vacant building on the same street where we would sell.
      Opening the ice cream shop was perfect for us. We made a wider range of food rather than just ice cream. Our customers no longer has to worry about waiting
      out in the heat or only seeing us on a Sunday. We offer much more than just ice cream, things like elotes, coffee, tortas.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Today...</strong></em>Business has been booming ever since we opened our shop in 2016. We have customer filling up out the door,
        especially in the summer. We’ve never had a bad encounter with any customers, to say the least we make small talk with our customers because they’re the best.
        They’re the reason our business was able to grow and they’re the reason we still stand and push through obstacles.
        To satisfy our customers we also add new flavors of ice cream for them to try and enjoy, so they won’t bore themselves with the same flavors.</p>
